# Material UI - Next.js App Router in TypeScript

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/HEAD/packages/create-next-app) with Material UI installed.

## Description

This frontend application was built to run on [another group's web API](https://github.com/parker7johnson/460-Backend). It uses React, Next.js, and Material UI to create a simple app with a navigation bar and pages to (1) search for books, (2) view a book's details, and (3) add a new book to the database.

## How to use

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
